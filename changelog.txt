****Added meaning to variable declarations****
for example, 
int x=5         z=7
int x=6         int z=3 
will not work as x is already declared above
also 
int x=5
x="drff"
will not work as x is an integer
int x=5.3 will be 5
float x=5 will be 5.0
(no errors will be show, value will be type casted automatically)

****Added String support****
int x =scan() and if the input value is a string
error will be shown
string z=scan() will accept anything and convert number to a string automatically
string z=2834 will also convert number to string
for now x="kemkemf {1+2}" will stay as it is
formatted strings only supported in print

fixed the x=x+1 error
added AND,OR, NOT to if and while

decided to fix the string error
made variables inside functions their own variables. any changes to them won't affect the rest of the program
example: x inside a function is separate from x used in the program
